SVM HOG
The face detection is one of the easiest methods to distinguish the identity of each other. Face recognition is a personal identification system that uses personal characteristics of a person to identify the person’s identity.
The project has two phases namely face detection and face recognition. Face of a person is given as an input either as an image or as a live capture on the webcam using the OpenCV library the faces are detected on the picture it uses Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm at its backend which makes 128 measurements for a single preloaded image which was loaded for training Thus, creates a box over the detected image .The second part i.e., face recognition is done using SVM classifier algorithm which distinguishes the faces using the 128 measurements generated by the HOG and recognizes the faces which are feed as input to the system. With the help of the previously trained images the system identified the person and names the person on the box. Then the timelines are marked while the face is detected and the time is loaded in an excel sheet as an attendance . Thus, PyQt5 is used to give out a grand GUI for the software. PyQt5 is a current version of GUI toolkit developed by riverbank computing.
